This personal project aims to PREDICT THE SUCCESS OF SPACE-X STAGE 1 RECOVERY. It is the Capstone project for IBM Data Science's Professional Certification
• Explored data using SQL and visualization tools, created interactive folium maps and dashboards, and identified
20+ relevant features.
• Transformed categorical variables to binary with one-hot encoding, standardized data, and optimized machine
learning models, achieving a 15% performance improvement using GridSearchCV.
• Developed four ML models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, KNN) with 83.33% accuracy, indicating effective
prediction of SpaceX stage 1 recovery.
• Presented findings on SpaceX Stage 1 recovery, showing a 25% cost reduction and advancements in space exploration.
PERSONNEL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT DETECTION
• Developed a personnel protective equipment detection system using YOLOv8, achieving 90% accuracy in detecting
and classifying PPE items to ensure safety protocol compliance.
• Implemented real-time detection capabilities for swift response to safety concerns. Collaborated with team members to optimize model performance and enhance detection accuracy
