# PREDICTING THE SUCCESS OF SPACE-X STAGE 1 RECOVERY<br/>
### This personal project aims to predict the success of a space-x shuttle's stage 1 recovery for a fictional company called 'Space-Y'. It is the Capstone project for IBM Data Science's Professional Certification<br/>
Some characterisitics of the project are given below :- <br/>
• Explored data using SQL and visualization tools, created interactive folium maps and dashboards, and identified
20+ relevant features. <br/>
• Transformed categorical variables to binary with one-hot encoding, standardized data, and optimized machine
learning models, improving performance improvement using GridSearchCV.<br/>
• Developed four ML models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, KNN) with 83.33% accuracy, indicating effective
prediction of SpaceX stage 1 recovery. <br/>
